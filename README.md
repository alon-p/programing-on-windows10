# Git
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
#### We use git a lot. share our code, make branches, tags, send to deploy pipelines

1. Install **Git** for windows: https://git-scm.com/.  
   It's up to you, but we recommend using the default install options.
   
#### Private / Public keys:

You will probably need to work with ssh keys to pull and push code to remote repos.
2. Install **Putty**: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html
3. In order to use private keys use **pageant** (from putty) and also add **GIT_SSH=PATH/TO/Plink.exe**  to your environment variables.

   they should also install pip for python2.

If you are trying to install some random dependey using `pip install`, and you get this error:    
`error: Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0 is required. Get it from http://aka.ms/vcpython27`
You probably need to install **Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7**: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266
